# Weekend Jquery Server Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 4 days_

This repo is designed to take in two input values, and complete a math operation using them. The equation will be computed on the server, and the result will be sent back. The application will also keep a history of all of the equations done, shown on screen, as well as the total of the current equation. Additionally, there will be a C button needed that will clear the input fields.
